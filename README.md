# Problem definition
Design and implement a service component that will send birthday wishes to employees.

The service must extract a list of employees whose birthdays occur today using the Realm Digital Employee API
and create a generic message E.g. “Happy Birthday {name 1}, {name 2}” and send the message to an email
address configured for the component.
